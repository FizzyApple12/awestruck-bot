## Using server-side rendering

This template uses a [custom Webpack override](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/webpack). If you are using server-side rendering, you need to import the override function from `./src/webpack-override.ts` and pass it to [`bundle()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/bundle) (if using SSR) and [`deploySite()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/deploysite) (if using Lambda).
